scala-code-snippets
===================

A repository created for dumping various usefull (and not so usefull) scala code snippets that I wrote.

This code is not supposed to :
- reflect best practices
- showcase state-of-the-art scala coding style
- demonstrate my mastery of the Scala langage and FP techniques
